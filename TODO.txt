1. View modes
  -Backbone = only backbone
  -Skeleton = only backbone + sidechain backbone
  -Space filling = spheres only, sphere diamater automatically determined based on whole model scale
  -X-ray = Atoms are glass, backbone + side chain plotted with opaque blocks
  -X-ray backbone = Atoms are glass, backbone plotted with opaque blocks
  -Max = scaled model to world height
  -Min = scale model to smallest size possible (no scale)

2. GUI
  -Scale (bond distance) control
  -Atom diamater control
  -Atom color
  -Bond (backbone and sidechain) color
  -Choose file
  -Choose output directory
  
3. Better plot area determination
  -Drop command block and model relative to player orientation
  -Plot so that bottom most block is at Y of command block

4. Better output directory.
  - select only the save, automatically add the correct file structure to the /datapacks folder
