# PDB to Minecraft
## Author: Markus Nevil

The structures of proteins and other biomolecules determined by X-ray crystallography, NMR, and cryo-EM are published at the RCSB Protein Data Bank (rcsb.org). These structures are primarily viewed using free or paid utilites whose learning curve may pose an inaccessible barrier to for educators, students, and the general public. This program's purpose is to make a fun and accessible alternative by generating files that can be loaded by the popular video game Minecraft. This guide includes a quick start, glossary of terms, description of features, and a walk through to generate a model of the included GFP model.

## Quick Start:

**TODO**
```
git clone
